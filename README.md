# Referrals prototype

----

## Setup and install

#### Requirements

These are required, but skip this step if you already have them installed

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install Gulp CLI on the command-line with `npm install -g gulp`


#### Project installation

You'll need to `cd` into the repo directory and run `npm install`:

```
cd <Referrals-app-folder>
npm install
```

This will then setup all the development and production dependencies we need.

Now simply run this to boot up the server:

```
npm start
```

Everything you do will be inside of `/src`, and everything is compiled and outputted inside `/dist`.
